# 0.2.0

* Bug fixes and enahncements (#12 and #13)
* Addition of an example to demonstrate using ngUpload to submit a full form, with a file input and other types of inputs, to the server.
* Example also demonstate how to consume a JSON returned by the server in Angular. (Checkout example 5 on the demo page(s) - [ASP.Net MVC](http://ng-upload.azurewebsites.net) or [NodeJS](http://ng-upload.eu01.aws.af.cm/).

## Update 0.1.1

* ngUpload is now an AngularJS Directive, removing the need to deal with the form[@id] attribute.
* Addition of the __uploadOptionsEnableControls__ option to prevent the default disabling of submission controls during upload, like so:
``` html
<form ng-upload='callbackFunction(contents, completed)' uploadOptionsEnableControls>
   ...
</form>
```
_Submission controls are html elements marked with the **upload-submit** css class_.
* Some bug fixes.
